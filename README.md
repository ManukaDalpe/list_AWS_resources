# Web_app_for_list_AWS_resources
This web app made up from H2o wave app for listing AWS resources of users.

Here, my task is to build a web app for listing any AWS resources by a user. As my first attempt, I was able to make a web app for listing down AWS resources of an IAM user, but the problem with that is, it is not included each and every AWS resources but it covers most using services like EC2,S3,VPC etc.
Here I made 3 free AWS accounts and assigned a IAM user for each account as user1,user2 and user3.
